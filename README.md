<h1>📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction</h1>
<h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry. Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project builds a Machine Learning pipeline to predict whether a telecom customer will churn based on demographic, behavioral, and subscription-related features.

The final solution is deployed using Streamlit with SHAP-based explainability to provide transparent predictions.

<h2>🎯 Business Problem</h2>

Telecom companies face revenue loss due to customer churn.

The objective of this project is:

To accurately predict whether a customer will churn so that the company can take proactive retention actions.

<h2>📂 Dataset Information</h2>

📊 Total Rows: 505,207

📌 Total Features: 12

Key Features:

Age

Gender

Tenure

Usage Frequency

Support Calls

Payment Delay

Subscription Type (Basic, Standard, Premium)

Contract Length (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual)

Total Spend

Last Interaction

Target Variable: Churn (0/1)

<h2>🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights</h2>

Key business insights discovered:

📌 Customers with Monthly contracts have higher churn rate.

📌 Customers with more than 4 support calls show strong churn tendency.

📌 Payment delays greater than 20 days significantly increase churn probability.

📌 Customers with Total Spend < 500 are more likely to churn.

📌 Customers above 50 years have higher churn probability.

<h2>🛠 Tech Stack</h2>

Python

Pandas

OrdinalEncoder → Subscription Type & Contract Length

Pipeline used for clean preprocessing + modeling

<h2>🤖 Model Selection</h2>

The following models were evaluated using cross-validation:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

LightGBM

<h2>📈 Best Performing Models:</h2>

Random Forest

LightGBM

<h2>🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning</h2>

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using Optuna for:

Random Forest

LightGBM

Both models showed comparable performance with similar:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

<h2>📊 Model Evaluation</h2>

Recall

F1-Score

Classification Report

Both RandomForest and LightGBM achieved strong and balanced performance on the test set.

<h2>🚀 Streamlit Web App</h2>

An interactive web application was built using Streamlit where users can:

Enter customer details

Get churn prediction

View churn probability

See SHAP Waterfall explanation for transparency

<h2>🔍 Features of the App:</h2>

✔ Real-time prediction
✔ Probability score
✔ SHAP explainability
✔ Clean UI

<h2>🧠 Explainable AI (SHAP)</h2>

To ensure model transparency:

Used shap.TreeExplainer

Generated SHAP Waterfall plots

Identified top contributing features for each prediction

This makes the model production-ready and trustworthy.
