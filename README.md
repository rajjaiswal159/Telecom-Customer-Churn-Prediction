<h1>📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction</h1>
<h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry. Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project builds a Machine Learning pipeline to predict whether a telecom customer will churn based on demographic, behavioral, and subscription-related features.

The final solution is deployed using Streamlit with SHAP-based explainability to provide transparent predictions.

🎯 Business Problem

Telecom companies face revenue loss due to customer churn.

The objective of this project is:

To accurately predict whether a customer will churn so that the company can take proactive retention actions.

📂 Dataset Information

📊 Total Rows: 505,207

📌 Total Features: 12

✅ Dataset is balanced

❌ No duplicate rows

❌ No outliers in numerical features

🧹 Null values removed

Key Features:

Age

Gender

Tenure

Usage Frequency

Support Calls

Payment Delay

Subscription Type (Basic, Standard, Premium)

Contract Length (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual)

Total Spend

Last Interaction

Target Variable: Churn (0/1)

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights

Key business insights discovered:

📌 Customers with Monthly contracts have higher churn rate.

📌 Customers with more than 4 support calls show strong churn tendency.

📌 Payment delays greater than 20 days significantly increase churn probability.

📌 Customers with Total Spend < 500 are more likely to churn.

📌 Customers above 50 years have higher churn probability.

🚀 Streamlit Web App

An interactive web application was built using Streamlit where users can:

Enter customer details

Get churn prediction

View churn probability

See SHAP Waterfall explanation for transparency

🔍 Features of the App:

✔ Real-time prediction
✔ Probability score
✔ SHAP explainability
✔ Clean UI

🧠 Explainable AI (SHAP)

To ensure model transparency:

Used shap.TreeExplainer

Generated SHAP Waterfall plots

Identified top contributing features for each prediction

This makes the model production-ready and trustworthy.
